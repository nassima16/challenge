       named Andy Davis. As Andy's favorite since kindergarten, Woody <br>
       served as the leader of Andy's toys, a position he upheld by <br>
       looking out for each member of the group. When Andy enters <br>
       adulthood and leaves for college, Woody is donated to a little girl <br>
       named Bonnie Anderson. He remains with Bonnie for some time, <br>

       He is a spaceman action figure originally belonging to Andy <br>
       Davis. Buzz was created during a time where astronauts were <br>
       especially popular amongst children. His arrival in the original Toy <br>
       Story created conflict with Andy's favorite toy Sheriff Woody,<br>
       though this rivalry would eventually blossom into a lifelong <br>
       friendship.
